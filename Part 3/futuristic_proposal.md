**Contributor 5: [Tsatsawane]**

## Title: AI-Powered Neural Interface for Personalized Cognitive Enhancement

---

## Problem Statement:

By 2030, the digital demands of modern life will significantly increase cognitive strain, leading to issues such as mental fatigue, attention disorders, and stress-related cognitive decline. Current mental wellness tools are reactive rather than proactive, lacking the capacity to monitor real-time mental states and intervene before issues escalate.

**Proposed Solution:**  
An AI-powered wearable neural interface device that continuously monitors brain activity and physiological data. The AI model interprets this data in real time to detect signs of mental fatigue, stress, or distraction and responds with personalized interventions such as focus exercises, adjusting digital environments, or recommending breaks.
